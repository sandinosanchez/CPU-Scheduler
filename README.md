# CPU-Scheduler

A cpu shceduler with memory allocation handling, supporting four algorithms to load process to the CPU. The GUI is implemented in JavaFX.

The algoritmhms are:

  - FCFS (First Come First Service)
  - RR (Round Robin)
  - SJF (Shortest Job First)
  - SRTF (Shortest Remaining Time First)
  
The memory allocation allows two different systems of partitioning and two algorithms to handle memory allocation.

  - Memory Models
  
    - Static partitions
    - Dynamic Partitions
    
  - Memory allocating
  
    - First Fit algorithm
    - Best Fit algorithm
